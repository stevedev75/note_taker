# Note Taker

## Application to generate a note taking tool using full stack web development.

My motivation for this project was to create a web application that uses JavaScript, node.js, and express (along with some starter code),
to create a note taker tool that accepts text for a Note Title and a Note, and saves them both -- providing a good user experience. 

I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of JavaScript, node.js and express, as well as a fundamental understanding of deploying
an application on Heroku.

This application solves the problem often of how to build a full stack tool which connects the front end code with the back end code while with providing a seamless user experience.

In this project, I learned a lot -- more specifically -- about Express and npm tools, and more JavaScript.
